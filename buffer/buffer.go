// A Buffer stores pages status information, such as if it's pinned
// and if that's the case, what block it is assigned to.
// Each buffer observes the changes done to its page and it is responsible
// for writing its modifications to disk.
// A Buffer can reduce disk access by delaying flushing:
// for example, if a page is modified several times , then it is more
// efficient to write the page once, after all modifications.
// The Buffer will flush its underlying page only in case the page is
// assigned to a different block, or if the recovery manager needs to write to disk to guard agains a crash.
